# AQ2 Pickup

Discord bot

Based on [kkrypt0nn's Python Discord Bot Template](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template) version 4.**

Here is a work-in-progress Discord bot written in Python to get info from AQ2-TNG/AQtion servers and do some light server admin tasks.

Many thanks to [TgT](https://github.com/m4son/) for help with the code and for taking the time to answer many of my questions, which made things actually start to work. üòÑ This is my first attempt at coding anything, so take it for what it is! Everything might not work 100%. üòÖ

Also, many thanks to FragBait at [aq2world](https://discord.aq2world.com) for many of the thumbnails!

## Requirements

* [kkrypt0nn's discordbot-template](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template/)
* [Qstat](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/qstat/)
* [pyrcon](https://github.com/texnofobix/pyrcon/)
* [q2admin with Lua](https://github.com/actionquake/q2admin/tree/aqtion)
* `sendtoAPI.lua` to use with q2admin, this will allow any server to send map results through the bot. You need to change the API address to make it work.
* And all imports (there might be some that are not needed that I have missed to remove..)

## Usage

Follow instructions for the bot-template, pyrcon, and qstat. Then, some more steps to make it work if you want to use it for yourself. Changes will be made to make it easier to set up, hopefully! üòÅ

## What now?

Feel free to manipulate this code as much as you want and for sure make it better. I'll help the best I can, but I'm not so fast to answer questions or even sit down at the computer. Also, big thanks to [kkrypt0nn](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/), [texnofobix](https://github.com/texnofobix/), and [Unity-Technologies](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/) for the great work with the tools I use to get this small project working.

## License

What? Oh yeah... read the licenses from qstat, kkrypt0nn's discordbot-template, pyrcon and pollinations.ai to see that all is good. I probably need to make some updates here also to comply. üòÖ
