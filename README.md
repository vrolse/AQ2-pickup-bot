 discordbot

Based on github.com/kkrypt0nn - Python Discord Bot Template version 4.**

Here is a work in progress discordbot written in python to get info from aq2-tng/aqtion servers and do some light serveradmin stuff.

Many thanks to [TgT](https://github.com/m4son/) for help with the code and for the time to answer many of my questions so that things actually started to work. üòÑ
This is my first attempt to code anything so take it for what it is! Everything might not work 100% üòÖ

Also many thanks to FragBait @ [aq2world](https://discord.aq2world.com) for the thumbnails!

## Requirements

* [kkrypt0nn's discordbot-template](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template/) 
* [Qstat](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/qstat/)
* [pyrcon](https://github.com/texnofobix/pyrcon/)
* [q2admin with lua](https://github.com/actionquake/q2admin/tree/aqtion)
* lastmatch.lua to use with q2admin to get info from '!last and/or /last' command with the bot. Path needs to be edited.
* sendtoAPI.lua to use with q2admin, this will allow any server to send map result through the bot. Need to change the API address to make it work. 
* and all imports (might be some that is not needed that I have missed to remove..)

## Usage
Follow instructions for the bot-template, pyrcon and qstat. Then some more stuff to make it work if you want to use it for yourself. Changes will be made to make it easier to setup, hopefully üòÅ

## What now?
Feel free to manipulate this code as much as you want and for sure make it better. I'll help the best I can but I'm not so fast to answer questions or even sit down at the computer.
Also big thanks to [kkrypt0nn](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/), [texnofobix](https://github.com/texnofobix/) and [Unity-Technologies](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/) for the great work with the stuff I use and need to get this small project working.

## License
What? or yeah.. read the licences from qstat and kkrypt0nn's discordbot-template to see that all is good. Probably I need to make some updates here also so it complies.
